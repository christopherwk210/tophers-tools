# [Lottie Looper](https://chrisanselmo.com/tools/#/lottie-looper)

I made this tool because I sometimes have to wrestle with lottie animations at work that have an "intro" section and a "loop" section. I wanted an easy way to figure out good values to loop my animations without having to punch in numbers by hand.
