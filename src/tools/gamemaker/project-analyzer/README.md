# [Project Analyzer](https://topheranselmo.com/tools/project-analyzer)

Sometimes you want to know how many lines of code you have in your project, or maybe how many assets you have total. This tool allows you to find this information without having to download a program or upload any files. It uses an experimental API that seems to be in limbo, so browser compatible appears to be spotty.
