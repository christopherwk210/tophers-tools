# [GM Color Picker](https://topheranselmo.com/tools/color-picker)

A simple tool to make working with colors in GML faster and easier. Automatically converts color values into valid GML Hex (BGR Hex format), GML color construction functions like `make_colour_rgb`, and even raw GML integer color values which can be used as-is.

Note that the latest versions of GM support CSS style hex colors, so this tool might not be as necessary as it was before.
